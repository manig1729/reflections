When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  This makes it easier for us to work across different machines, or let other people
  have access to our repositories and work.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  We need to do this because we may need several commits in a single feature, and we
  might not want to make that feature public till we manually push the changes.
