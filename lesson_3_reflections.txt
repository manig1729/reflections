When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your 
work local?

  This makes it easier for us to work across different machines, or let 
  other people have access to our repositories and work.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  We need to do this because we may need several commits in a single feature,
  and we might not want to make that feature public till we manually push the 
  changes.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you 
use one instead of another?

	Forks are copies of repositories made on github directly, clones are copies
	of repositories from github onto a local machine, or between local
	machines, and branches are different 'versions' within a single repository.
	The use of these three varies significantly - We use forks when we want to
	modify a bit of someone's repository and make it public, clone is used when
	we don't really want to make our changes to a public repository public, and
	branch is used when we want to add a new version to our project, etc.
	
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
stored locally?

	This is helpful if we are going to be offline for a while and want to
	see where we had left off on the remote branch, instead of having to deal
	with people updating the branch on github.
	
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, 
and what would be harder?

	With git and github, collaborations would be very hard, as there won't be
	much sense as to who edited what, and everyone will need to decide on a
	format and save previous versions of files, which is tedious.
